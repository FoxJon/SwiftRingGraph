# SwiftRingGraph
A custom animated circle graph in Swift

Use this code to create a custom animated circle graph. Customize it however you like. Currently, if you tap the center, it will generate a random percentage between 50% - 100%. The outer circle will fill to that percentage. Tap again to get another random number. Enjoy!
